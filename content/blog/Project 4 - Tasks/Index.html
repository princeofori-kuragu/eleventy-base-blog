    <!--    a) Make a variable called "temperature". Write some code that tells you to put on a coat if it is below 50 degrees

            b) Extend the Program to show the following:

            If it's less than 50 degrees, wear a coat.
            If it's less than 30 degrees, wear a coat and a hat.
            If it's less than 0 degrees, stay inside.
            Otherwise, just pants and vest is fine.
            
            c) Add a logical operator to your ‘Shall I wear a coat?’ program
